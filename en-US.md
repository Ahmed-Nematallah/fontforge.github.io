Welcome
=======

Learning FontForge is easy &ndash; get started designing your own fonts with the [tutorial]. The software interface also has a full-fledged [documentation](/en-US/documentation/interface/).

Font conversion is also a simple task &ndash; see [how to convert between font formats](/en-US/tutorials/convert/).

Scripting is what allows designers to get repetitive tasks done quickly, and FontForge has excellent [scripting support](/en-US/documentation/scripting/) with both its own scripting language and [Python](/en-US/documentation/scripting/python/).

FontForge can be [customized](/en-US/documentation/customizing/) so it feels familiar, from hotkeys to visual themes and packs a translatable interface.

You can share copies of FontForge freely and make changes under a [libre license](/en-US/about/project/license/). You are invited to participate in this project; your bug reports, feature suggestions, tutorial ideas and code contributions are all welcome! [Learn more...](/en-US/documentation/developers/)
