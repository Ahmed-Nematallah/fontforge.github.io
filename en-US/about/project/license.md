title: FontForge’s License

FontForge is available as a whole under the terms of the
[GNU GPL](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html), version
3 or any later version. However, almost all of its parts are
available under the "[revised BSD license](http://www.law.yi.org/~sfllaw/talks/bsd.pdf),"
because FontForge was mostly written by George Williams
who only used that one.

The Revised BSD License is very permissive, and allows for code to be combined
with other code under other licenses. There are many useful libraries
available under copyleft libre licenses, such as the LGPL and GPL, which
FontForge started to use in 2012. For example, Pango and Cairo are
available under the LGPL, and gnulib is available under the GPL.

How To License Contributions
------------------------------

- Contributions to existing files must be made under the existing license for that file.
- Contributions in new files should be made under the original Revised BSD License, but any license compatible with the GPLv3 is okay.
