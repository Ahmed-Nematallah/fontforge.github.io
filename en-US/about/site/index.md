title: Edit This Website
---

Like FontForge itself, the website is developed [as a project](/en-US/about/project/index.html) where everyone is invited to contribute. The collaboration is organized through the [GitHub](http://github.com) website, so to contribute you'll need an account there. It totally only takes a few seconds to sign up for an account.

You may have seen the round 'Edit This Page' item in the footer of each page, with a couple of links. Once you are logged into GitHub, the little 'github' link will work for you to easily make changes to that page. There is also a link to [prose.io](http://prose.io) which is a more elegant way to edit files on Git Hub.
