title: About the FontForge Website
---

The website is under active development in US English. 

You may have seen the round 'Edit This Page' item in the footer of each page, with a couple of links. They work only if you are logged into [GitHub](http://github.com).

Like FontForge itself, the website is developed as a project on [GitHub](http://github.com), so you'll need to sign up for an account there. It totally only takes a few seconds.

Once you are logged in, you will be able to click the small 'GitHub' link in the footer's roundel.

There is also a link to [prose.io](http://prose.io) which is a more elegant way to edit files on Git Hub.
