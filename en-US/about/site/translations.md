title: FontForge Website Translations

The website is under active development in US English. 

If you'd like to start translating it, make a copy of the `/en-US` directory
and rename it with your language code, and start translating. When you think
the site is ready, make a pull request :-)

TODO: Make a modification to the language dropdown `_includes/nav-sub.html` so
that it will work to switch the URL (with the JS library jurlp) for users.
