## Download FAQ

<dl class="faq">

<dt>I thought FontForge was free software?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>FontForge is free in the sense that you are free
    to do anything with it that you want (including use
    it on as many machines as you wish, make copies of
    it for friends and so forth.) Some people like to
    explain this with the phrase "free as in free speech, not
    free as in free beer". It also helps to say "libre software"
    instead of "free software" to help distinguish these
    two different meanings in the ambiguous English language.</p>

  <p>It is also free in the sense that you can get the source code at any time and build
    it yourself. This can be a complicated and difficult task, especially on Mac OS X
    and Windows.</p>

  <p>This is a big, complex
    software project, and without revenue to support
    its development, it grinds to a halt. 
    Our download system is one way that we try
    to raise revenue. Please consider being a part of the
    wonderful group of people who help to make this continued
    development of FontForge possible.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Do I get any updates with the one-time download?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Yes, you will the minor updates (e.g. 2.3.1 to 2.3.2) since there might be critical bugs, but not 2.3.1 to 2.4. </p>
 </dd>
<!--
<dt>I gave a donation, but I'm still asked to pay to download?</dt>

<dd>The donation system is entirely separate from the download system, and exists for a couple of reasons:

  <ul>
    <li>our GNU+Linux users generally get FontForge without payment via their distributions' repositories, so they like to make donations instead.</li>
    <li>some people who already bought a copy or a subscription just feel like being extra generous</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Either way, it allows people to make a simple
  one-time payment. It is not part of the download
  system, and any payment you make via the donation
  system does not apply to the download
  system. Remember that you may choose to pay as little
  as US$1 for a download.</p>
  </dd>

<dt>I paid for a download but can't see a download link anywhere</dt>
<dd>You probably have page forwarding disabled in your web browser.
  Point it at <a href="">http://fontforge/download_revisit</a>, enter your invoice ID
  (not transaction ID) from the your payment confirmation email, and your
  download will start.
</dd>

<dt>My download links say that the timer has expired</dt>
<dd>Email <a href="mailto:">x@y.z</a> with your Invoice ID
  (not transaction ID) and we'll reset things.
</dd>

<dt>I tried to download 3 times and they all failed</dt>
<dd>Email <a href="mailto:">x@y.z</a> with your Invoice ID
  (not transaction ID) and we'll reset things.
