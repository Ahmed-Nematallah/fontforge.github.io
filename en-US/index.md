Welcome

__NEW RELEASE!__ We are happy to announce our latest version, the 2014 October release, with full UFO support. [Download now!](http://fontforge.github.io/en-US/downloads/)

Learning FontForge is easy &ndash; get started designing your own fonts with the [tutorial](/en-US/tutorials/). The entire [interface](/en-US/documentation/interface/) is fully documented.

Scripting allows designers to get repetitive tasks done quickly, and FontForge has excellent [scripting support](/en-US/documentation/scripting/) with both its own scripting language and [Python](/en-US/documentation/scripting/python/).

FontForge can be [customized](/en-US/documentation/customizing/) so it feels familiar, from hotkeys to visual themes and a translatable interface.

You can share copies of FontForge freely and make changes under a [libre license](/en-US/about/project/license/). You are invited to participate in this project; your bug reports, feature suggestions, [donations](https://www.tug.org/fonts/librefontfund.html), tutorial ideas and code contributions are all welcome!
