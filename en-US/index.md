## Welcome

Learning FontForge is easy &ndash; get started designing your own fonts with the [tutorial](/en-US/tutorials/). The entire [interface](/en-US/documentation/interface/) is fully documented.

Scripting allows designers to get repetitive tasks done quickly, and FontForge has excellent [scripting support](/en-US/documentation/scripting/) with both its own scripting language and [Python](/en-US/documentation/scripting/python/).

FontForge can be [customized](/en-US/documentation/customizing/) so it feels familiar, from hotkeys to visual themes and a translatable interface.

FontForge is an open source project and you are invited to participate. Your bug reports, feature suggestions, [donations](https://www.tug.org/fonts/librefontfund.html), tutorial ideas and code contributions are all welcome! [Learn more.](/en-US/documentation/developers/)
