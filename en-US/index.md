## Welcome

Learning FontForge is easy &ndash; we recommend that you start by reading [Design With FontForge](http://designwithfontforge.com/). The entire [interface](/en-US/documentation/interface/) is also fully documented.

FontForge has excellent [scripting support](/en-US/documentation/scripting/) that allows designers to get repetitive tasks done quickly.

FontForge is an open source project and you can contribute. Your bug reports, feature suggestions, [donations](https://www.tug.org/fonts/librefontfund.html), tutorial ideas and code contributions are needed for FontForge to improve! Learn more about FontForge development [here.](/en-US/documentation/developers/)
