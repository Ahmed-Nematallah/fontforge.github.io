---

## Welcome

FontForge is a free (libre) font editor for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU+Linux that is developed by us, the user community.

Learning to use FontForge is easy &ndash; check out the [Design With FontForge](http://designwithfontforge.com/) font design manual, and browse our comprehensive [documentation](/en-US/documentation/) that covered everything from each piece of the interface to scripting with Python.

FontForge is libre licensed and organized as an open source community project, so you are invited to contribute. 
Your bug reports, feature suggestions, [donations](https://www.tug.org/fonts/librefontfund.html), tutorial ideas and (if you are a software developer) code contributions are welcome! 
By co-operating together we make FontForge better and better. [Learn more...](/en-US/documentation/developers/)
