Welcome
==========

FontForge is libre software: you can share copies freely and make changes under a [libre license](/en-US/about/project/license.html). You are invited to participate in this project; your bug reports, feature suggestions, tutorial ideas and code contributions are all welcome! [Learn more...](/en-US/documentation/developer/)

Learning FontForge is easy. New users can get started with the [tutorials](/en-US/tutorials/index.html), and the entire [interface](/en-US/documentation/interface/index.html) is fully documented.

Font conversion is simple too. See this tutorial on [how to convert font formats](/en-US/tutorial/convert.html).

Scripting is allows designers to get repetitive tasks done quickly, and FontForge has excellent [scripting support](/en-US/documentation/scripting/index.html) with both its own scripting language and [Python](/en-US/documentation/scripting/python/index.html).

FontForge can be [customized](/en-US/documentation/customizing/index.html) so it feels familiar, from hotkeys to visual themes and a translatable interface.

This page will soon look like [this mockup page](/meta/home.html).
