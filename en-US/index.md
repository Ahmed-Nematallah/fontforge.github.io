Welcome
==========

FontForge is libre software: you can share copies freely and make changes
under a [BSD-style license](https://github.com/about/project/license.html).
You are invited to participate in this project; your bug reports, feature
suggestions, tutorial ideas and code contributions are all welcome! [Learn
more...](/documentation/developer/)

<p>Learning FontForge is easy. New users can get started with the
[tutorials](/tutorial), and the entire [interface](/documentation/interface/)
is fully documented.

Font conversion is simple too. See this tutorial on [how to convert font
formats](/tutorial/convert.html).

Scripting is allows designers to get repetitive tasks done quickly, and
FontForge has excellent [scripting support](/documentation/scripting/) with
both its own scripting language and
[Python](/documentation/scripting/python.html).

FontForge can be [customized](/documentation/customizing/) so it feels
familiar, from hotkeys to visual themes and a translatable interface.

This page will soon look like [this mockup
page](http://fontforge.github.com/meta/home.html).
