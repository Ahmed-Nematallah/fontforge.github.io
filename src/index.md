Fontforge is a font editor
===========================

Create and edit fonts in many formats: OpenType, TrueType, AAT, PostScript,
Multiple Master, CID-Keyed, SVG and many bitmap formats.

FontForge is libre software: you can share copies freely and make changes
under a [BSD-style license](/about/project/license.html). You are invited to
participate in this project, and bug reports, feature suggestions,
documentation and code contributions are all welcome!

Welcome
--------------

New users can learn a lot from the [tutorials](/tutorial), and the
[interface](/documentation/interface/) is fully documented.

Font conversion is also simple, see this tutorial on [how to convert font
formats](/tutorial/convert.html).

Scripting is an essential part of any font editor, and FontForge has excellent
[scripting](/documentation/scripting/) support, with both its own scripting
language and [Python](/documentation/scripting/python.html).

Users can customize FontForge, including customizing hotkeys, visual theme,
and translation of the interface.

Become an active user
----------------------

Most of FontForge was created by a single person, George Williams, as a
retirement project from 2000 until 2011. Read the full story on the
[history](/about/history.html) page. Since then, a community of active users
maintain the project, including:

- Can this list be made automatically via github api?
- Some One
- Someone Else
- The Third Man
- Another Person

FontForge is under active development, so it is essentially (and eternally)
beta software. Expect to find bugs. When you do, please become an active user
yourself and take 5 minutes to [report a bug](bugs.html) on Github, so it can
be fixed.
