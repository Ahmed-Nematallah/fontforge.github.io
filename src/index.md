Fontforge is a font editor
===========================

Create and edit fonts in many formats: OpenType, TrueType, AAT, PostScript,
Multiple Master, CID-Keyed, SVG and various bitmap formats.

FontForge is libre software: you can share copies freely and make changes under a 
<a href="https://github.com/about/project/license.html">BSD-style license</a>. You are invited to 
participate in this project; your bug reports, feature suggestions, tutorial ideas and code 
contributions are all welcome! <a href="/documentation/developer/">Learn more...</a>

Welcome
--------------

Learning FontForge is easy. New users can get started with the 
<a href="/tutorial">tutorials</a>, and the entire 
<a href="/documentation/interface/">interface</a> is fully documented.

Font conversion is simple with FontForge. See this tutorial on 
<a href="/tutorial/convert.html">how to convert font formats</a>.

Scripting is an essential part of any font editor, and FontForge has excellent
<a href="/documentation/scripting/">scripting support</a>, with both its own scripting
language and <a href="/documentation/scripting/python.html">Python</a>.

You can <a href="/documentation/customizing/">customize FontForge</a> 
simply too, from hotkeys to the visual theme and translation of the interface 
into your language.

Become an active user
----------------------

Most of FontForge was created by a single person, George Williams, as a
retirement project from 2000 until 2011. You can read the full story on the
<a href="/about/history.html">history</a> page.

Currently a community of active users maintains the project, including:

- Can this list be made automatically via github api?
- Some One
- Someone Else
- The Third Man
- Another Person

FontForge is under active development, so it is essentially (and eternally)
beta software. Expect to find bugs. When you do, please become an active user
yourself and take 5 minutes to <a href="/documentation/developers/bugs.html">report 
a bug</a> on Github, so it can be fixed.
