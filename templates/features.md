**FontForge** -- An outline font editor that lets you create your own
postscript, truetype, opentype, cid-keyed, multi-master, cff, svg and
bitmap (bdf, FON, NFNT) fonts, or edit existing ones. Also lets you
convert one format to another. FontForge has support for many macintosh
font formats.

FontForge's user interface has been localized for: (English), Russian,
Japanese, French, Italian, Spanish, Vietnamese, Greek, Simplified &
Traditional Chinese, German, Polish, Ukrainian and Catalan.\
 This website itself has been translated into Japanese
[![](flags/Nisshoki-Japan.png)](ja/) and the tutorial into traditional
Chinese
[![](flags/taiwan.png)](http://edt1023.sayya.org/fontforge/editexample.html)
and German [![](flags/GermanFlag.png)](de/editexample.html).
Translations are often out of date, I fear.
